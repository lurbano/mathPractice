    <div id="Instructions">
        Instructions: Enter answers as an equation like <span class="entryDemo">x = 4</span>. Have the variable on the left hand side and the solved value on the right. 
        Instructions: You may use fractions for the value as in <span class="entryDemo">x = 1/3</span>. This is more accurate for repeating decimal numbers.
